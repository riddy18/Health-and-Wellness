# Health-and-Wellness

Abstract:


Introduction:
Do we have an accurate understanding of the health and wellness models as it relates to the following factors:
→ sun exposure

→ environmental pollutants
Environmental pollutants are chemicals that have ended up in the environment as a result of human activities and that are hazardous to health [1]. These chemical compounds are harmful to both life and the environment. For a comprehensive list of various environmental pollutants and their effect on our environment, see this article [2].
The core principle of environmental wellness is respect for all nature and the species living in it. When you become environmentally aware, you will be able to realize how your daily habits affect the environment. 
A large repository of datasets relating to environmental pollutants can be found here: https://data.world/datasets/pollution. 
→ noise and light pollution

→ access to quality healthcare

→ biodiversity

Methodology
→ Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/epa/hazardous-air-pollutants
This kaggle summary has 2GB of data from EPA as well as description and metadata. It was updated up till May 01, 2017 and we plan to collect more recent data via BigQuery as this might help us see how well our model generalizes on newer data. It has about 30 features representing data from all states and some territories like puerto rico and almost 8.1 million instances.
